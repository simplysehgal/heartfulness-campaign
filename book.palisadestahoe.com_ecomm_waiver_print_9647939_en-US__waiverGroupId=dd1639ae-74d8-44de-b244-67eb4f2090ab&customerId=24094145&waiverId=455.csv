2/23/2024 9:46:31,Yes,1,1,5,"Teaching methods -
1. Do small group discussions in class than just having to raise hands - this will help students speak up if they arenâ€™t comfortable speaking in front of whole class
2. Wait before calling a name - wait for 20-30 seconds before calling a name of the student. This gives opportunity for more students to raise hands. 
3. Give students a heads-up - profs should know students professional experience and should give students a heads-up before class to let them know that they value their inputs in specific cases or topics as that matches with their professional background"
